# ARRAYLENGTH
QUESTION DESCRIPTION
Consider every susequence of an array of integers.

• Sort the subsequence in increasing order.
• Determine the sum of differences of elements in the subsequence.
• Return the length of the longest subsequence where this sum is even.

We can see that the máximum posible length of a valid subsequence is 4.

## Function Description
Complete the function findLongestSubsequence in the editor below.
FindLongestSubsequence has the following parameter(s):
* Int arr[n]: an array of integers

## Returns
* Int: the length of the longest subsquence as describe
